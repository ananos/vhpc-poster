%Virtualization has become a common abstraction layer in modern
%data centers, enabling resource owners to manage complex
%infrastructure independently of their applications. Conjointly,
%virtualization is becoming a driving technology for a manifold of
%industry grade IT services. The cloud concept includes the notion
%of a separation between resource owners and users, adding services
%such as hosted application frameworks and queueing. Utilizing the
%same infrastructure, clouds carry significant potential for use in
%high-performance scientific computing. The ability of clouds to provide
%for requests and releases of vast computing resources dynamically and
%close to the marginal cost of providing the services is unprecedented in
%the history of scientific and commercial computing.
%
%This workshop aims to bring together industrial providers with the
%scientific community in order to foster discussion, collaboration
%and mutual exchange of knowledge and experience.
%
%The workshop will be one day in length, composed of 20 min
%paper presentations, each followed by 10 min discussion sections.
%Lightning talks are limited to 5 minutes. Presentations may be
%accompanied by interactive demonstrations.
%
